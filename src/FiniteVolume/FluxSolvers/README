README for fluxsolvers

FluxSolvers consist of several components which may be chosen at run time.
These are:

> FluxCalculator
    - The 'core' of the FluxSolver. This takes a number of grid parameters
      and state vectors and returns a numerical flux. Examples include:
        * Lax-Friedrich
        * Richtmyer (two-stage Lax-Wendroff)
        * FORCE
        * HLLC (approximate Riemann solver)
    - All FluxSolvers MUST make use of a FluxCalculator

> Reconstructor
    - A tool which takes a number of StateVectors from the grid and returns
      a reconstructed state at the desired location. As of writing, the only
      method implemented so far is the MUSCL reconstruction, though some 
      Godunov methods may be usable at a future date.
    - The default reconstructor is the trivial case in which two states are
      taken on either side of a cell interface, and those two states are
      immediately returned.
    - Reconstructors can make use of optional Limiters, described below.

> Limiter
    - Found in the Reconstructors directory.
    - An optional component of a Reconstructor. Takes a number of
      StateVectors, determines the local slope, and limits according to
      how steep the local gradients are.
