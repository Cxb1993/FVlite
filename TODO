> Generalise Updater class
    - Implement an 'EventSequencer', which can be set up
      at run time or load from set of defaults.
    - This will contain a 'std::vector<Event*>', where 
      'Event' is a class which performs some task over
      the grid. An example is an x-sweep, or a boundary
      update.
    - The 'Events' themselves should be modifiable. For
      example, an x-sweep will need a flux method, an
      explicit update formula, etc.
> remove 'char dim' from everything -- use templates
> fWlayer implementation
    - Make it part of an 'AbsorbingLayer' class.
> Template everything over FiniteVolume scheme?
    - Will need to plan this stage well
