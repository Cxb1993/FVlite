> Overhaul looping
    - Code could be greatly sped up by replacing double nested
      loops with single nested loops and clever iterators.
      This may allow the code to be switched easily from 1D to
      2D to 3D, simply by choosing a different iterator and looping
      from .start() to .end().
    - For y-sweeps, it may be necesarry to use two iterators, one of
      which is offset from the other such that it is always one row above.
    - Perhaps just use one but add a constant to get the one-row-above
      pointer?
        * no, way faster to add a constant at the start and iterate. But
          then how will larger stencils be handled?
        * boom, implement an iterating stencil class! The stencil could change
          to account for x-sweeps vs y-sweeps, and everything else would
          remain the same!
    - It is not immediately obvious how to skip over ghost cells efficiently.
      If the position is determined from the iterator once per loop, that
      would actually be less efficient.
    - Perhaps the stencil should store the current coordinate? It could iterate
      over ii too, perform a check to see if ii>=ghosts, and if so set ii=0 and jj++.
      Similar for kk.
> Implement stencil class
    - see above for intended purpose
    - what should create it? Should it be passed all the way down to flux
      calculators?
> Generalise Updater class
    - Implement an 'EventSequencer', which can be set up
      at run time or load from set of defaults.
    - This will contain a 'std::vector<Event*>', where 
      'Event' is a class which performs some task over
      the grid. An example is an x-sweep, or a boundary
      update.
    - The 'Events' themselves should be modifiable. For
      example, an x-sweep will need a flux method, an
      explicit update formula, etc.
> remove 'char dim' from everything -- use templates
> fWlayer implementation
    - Make it part of an 'AbsorbingLayer' class.
> Template everything over FiniteVolume scheme?
    - Will need to plan this stage well
